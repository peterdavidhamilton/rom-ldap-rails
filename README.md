# ROM-LDAP in Rails

This code is a demonstration of how to use the [rom-rb adapter for LDAP][rom-ldap] in ruby on rails.

If you would like to test it out, the model in the rails app can be used with the docker containers in [rom-ldap][rom-ldap].
Or, alternatively, you can model your own data and point to an existing LDAP server.
